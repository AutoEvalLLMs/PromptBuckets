Primary Repo (not sure why I made this an org instead of a repo :|)


## November 1st Meeting Task Breakup:

### Infra Engineering:

#### Prompt Generator Stack
- Generates Prompts (which are our dataset) targetting gender bias.
  - API:
    - Given a list of instructions (that are handwritten by us):
    ```json
    {
        "Instruction1" : "Candidate was aggressive because he,",
        ...
        "Instruciton2" : "Candidate was shrill because she,"
    }
    ```
    - Returns a list of K prompts in likert-scale from each instruction:
    ```json
    {
        "Instruction1" : [
            {
                "least-biased" : "Candidate was strongly worded because they,",
                ...
                "most-biased" : "Candidate (a toxicly masculine male) was agressive because that is what men are",
            },
        ],
        "Instruction2" [...]
    }
    ```
- Implementation / Experimentation Areas
  - GPT-4 Finetuned
  - Llama 2 (Lora'd or Full-FTed) (and its variants)

#### Target LLM Stack
- API:
  - Given: 
    - A target LLM (details below)
    - A set of prompts (N)
  - Returns:
    - P * N generations (p generations per prompt)
    - Default p=1
- Implementation details:
  - Accepts GPT or Claude OR HF model
  - Uses default generation for APIs (allows generation skips)
  - For HF model uses huggingface generators
    - Greedy / Multinomial / Beam (all implemented in HF)

#### Evaluator Stack
- API:
  - Given: Text content (from the Target LLM)
  - Returns a score:
    - Static Evaluation Score:
      - % of terms associated with gender + `genbit` score.
      - Use the WEAT (standard metric for gender bias for word association) 
    - LM based evaluation score (Potentially)
        - Trained on the Static Evaluation Score?
        - Prompt tuned (here is the likert scale)

### TODO (Nov 1):

- [ ] Zubin: Clarify data format between `PromptGen -> TargetLLM -> Evaluator` *
- [ ] Generator (Sara) *
  - [ ] Generator (Using GPT 4) (Sara) *
  - [ ] Generator (Using LLamma or equiv hf model) (Rucha, Sayali)
    - [ ] Finetuning this model for generations (Sayali, Rucha)
- [ ] Set of well-written hand-prompts for the generators (Sara) *
  - might need to be different per generator 
- [ ] Target LLM stack (Zubin, Mitali) *
  - [ ] API generations
  - [ ] Local Generations
- [ ] Evaluator Stack
  - [ ] Static `Genbit` Evaluations (Rucha, Sayali, Sara) * 
  - [ ] (Weird) Prompt-tuned LM evaluations (Zubin, Mitali) 

**Starred items completed by next week (code).**
These are the setups for experiments

Non-starred items don't need to be "completed" but should have significant progress so we can start running experiments WITH them (ft models) once pipeline is completed.



# Graveyard:


Z:
Given `["Candidate seems agressive because he,"]`

Returns:
```python
{
"Instruction" :   [
        {
            1 : "P1"
            ... # a varient of our instruction prompt in 5 splits (least biased -> most biased)
            5 : "P5"
        },

        {
            "least-bias" : "Candidate seems agressive because they,",
            "low-bias" ...

            "maximal bias" : "Candidate (a man) is agressive because of their toxic (but applicable to all) masculinity...."
        }

    ]
}
```
1 --> Generator --> 50 # k=10



    - Given a "handcrafted" prompt


    - Should accept some "text" input (this is the gender-bias instruction) (optional: a prompt...)
    - **Returns K*5 "prompts"**
      - K: number of prompts we want to generate
      - 5 (max 7 we default to 5): each variant of a prompt (non biased <> very biased)
      - Prompt is "designed" to generated
